# How Does JavaScript Execute Code + Call Stack

## Execution Context in JavaScript

To understand this concept, we first need to understand how the **Execution Context** works.

- When we run any JavaScript code, it first creates a **Global Execution Context (GEC)** and assigns it to the `this` variable.
- The execution context differs slightly between **browsers and Node.js**.
- JavaScript executes inside a **single thread**, meaning it is a **single-threaded language**.
- There are **three types of execution contexts**:
  - **Global Execution Context**
  - **Functional Execution Context**
  - **Eval Execution Context**

## Execution Process in JavaScript

When JavaScript code runs, it follows a structured process consisting of **two phases**:

### üîπ Example Code Snippet

```js
let val1 = 10;
let val2 = 20;
function sumOfTwo(num1, num2) {
  let total = num1 + num2;
  return total;
}

let result1 = sumOfTwo(val1, val2);
let result2 = sumOfTwo(5, 7);
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Memory Creation Phase**

In this phase, JavaScript **allocates memory** for all variables and functions **before execution begins**:

- `val1` ‚Üí `undefined`
- `val2` ‚Üí `undefined`
- `sumOfTwo` ‚Üí **Function Definition**
- `result1` ‚Üí `undefined`
- `result2` ‚Üí `undefined`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Execution Phase**

In this phase, JavaScript assigns values to variables and executes the functions.

- `val1` ‚Üê `10`, `val2` ‚Üê `20`
- When `sumOfTwo(val1, val2)` is called, a **new execution context** is created.
- Inside the new execution context:
  - **Memory Phase:** `num1` ‚Üí `undefined`, `num2` ‚Üí `undefined`, `total` ‚Üí `undefined`
  - **Execution Phase:** `num1` ‚Üê `10`, `num2` ‚Üê `20`, `total` ‚Üê `30`
- The function **returns `total` to the global execution context**.
- Once execution is complete, the function's execution context **is removed from the stack**.

## üìå Call Stack in JavaScript

The **Call Stack** is a mechanism JavaScript uses to keep track of function execution. It follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle**.

### üîπ Example Code Snippet

```js
console.log("Start");

function first() {
  console.log("Inside first function");
  second();
}

function second() {
  console.log("Inside second function");
}

first();

console.log("End");
```

### üìä Call Stack Execution Steps

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC) is created**
2. `console.log("Start")` executes
3. `first()` is called ‚Üí **`first()` is added to the stack**
4. Inside `first()`, `second()` is called ‚Üí **`second()` is added to the stack**
5. `second()` finishes execution ‚Üí **`second()` is removed from the stack**
6. `first()` finishes execution ‚Üí **`first()` is removed from the stack**
7. `console.log("End")` executes
8. Global Execution Context is removed, and the **stack is empty**

### üìå Visual Representation of the Call Stack

```
1. Global Execution Context (GEC) created
2. console.log("Start") executes
3. first() is called ‚Üí first() added to the stack
4. Inside first(), second() is called ‚Üí second() added to the stack
5. second() finishes ‚Üí second() removed from stack
6. first() finishes ‚Üí first() removed from stack
7. console.log("End") executes
8. GEC removed, stack is empty
```
